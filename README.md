# MOVIE-RATING-PREDICTION
A machine learning model used to predict IMDB movie raing based on score matchbox recommender.
# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
By updating the entire status of each movie database,we can predict the movie decision accordingly.so that one could predict which movie is mosted rated.if the movie's viewer count is increasing then the movie review will increases which will be more useful for a new user.this model not only helps the fresh user,it also helps in reducing the man labour
work.
# AZURE SERVICES USED
Azure machine learning studio is used to create, train and evaluate the machine learning model. In Azure machine learning portal, select or import a dataset for the model. After uploading the dataset as CSV file, then select the blocks for the model and then connect and visualize the blocks. The final output will be visualized in the evaluated model
